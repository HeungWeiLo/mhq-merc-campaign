Shiloh is a harsh and desolate planet and is home to the Exituri, an anti-technology cult. The planet was first colonized in 2138 and has changed little since the earliest days. The land is tiled by oxen and plows and the planet actively shuns modern conveniences and technologies. Aside from a tightly controlled Spaceport, the population of Shiloh has limited connection to the rest of the Inner Sphere. The planet has the highest birthrate in the Free Worlds League, however this is offset by the high rate of childhood mortality due to the lack of modern medicine. The planet’s primary exports are wood and bone carvings, textiles and metal works.

3135 - An arid, windy, and nearly barren world, the only surface water on Shiloh takes the form of numerous scattered seas, lakes, and interconnecting rivers. Together with its lack of resources, the climate of this world would have left it uninhabited had it not attracted the notice of the Exituri. The Exituri, a secretive, religious sect that blends elements from faiths as diverse as Islam, Christianity, Hinduism, and even Paganism, left Terra early in the Exodus for ideological reasons. Settling on Shiloh, the Exituri quickly established a theocratic society, based on their precepts, known collectively as the Bhagavad-Gita. Shiloh became part of the Lyran Commonwealth‘s Federation of Skye in the years leading up to the formation of the original Star League, but took little active role in interplanetary politics. The planet‘s small population supported itself as best as possible, though their religious tenets limited them to using the most primitive means for farming and industry, while trade was limited to the export of local handcrafts in exchange for water. After the fall of the Star League and the beginnings of the Succession Wars, however, Shiloh became a target for frequent raids and invasions between Houses Steiner and Marik, eventually falling to the Free Worlds League in 2917. During the centuries of Succession Wars, the Exituri leadership exerted near complete control over the world,despite numerous rebellions against the hardliners of the government. At this time, the Exituri leadership of Shiloh preached often of the evils of advanced technology. They proclaimed that their Divinity no longer recognized mankind as a result of his increasing dependence on the tools of science and warfare, and they further condemned the Great Houses of the Inner Sphere, not just for the Succession Wars, but for all the tragedies of the human race. Ironically, the end of the Exituri‘s absolute rule of religion came at the hands of the zealots of the Word of Blake. Subverted by Blakist agents for years beforehand, the ancient Exituri government was washed aside, replaced by the Word‘s techno-theocracy within months after the Jihad began, transforming the Exituri youth into a new breed of fanatic dedicated to the Blakists‘ own causes of chaos and death. Shiloh became a favored locale for Blakist “reeducation camps” and a training ground for zealot commandos and MechWarriors alike, until the combined forces of Devlin Stone‘s coalition finally liberated the world near the end of the war. Shiloh‘s entrance into Stone‘s Republic signaled the world‘s rebirth, between the arrival of new residents and the establishment of economic initiatives aimed at rebuilding the planetary economy. Though sects of Exituri still remain, the religious group no longer dominates the local government, which was remade in The Republic‘s image. The capital city of Shiloh is Randersville, and it is located on  the north shore of Blessed Lake, in the northern hemisphere.
