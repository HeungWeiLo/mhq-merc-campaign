Al Na‘ir is the fifth planet from its parent star and is the only rock in the system that is even remotely capable of supporting life, with a sulfur-tainted atmosphere too thin for unassisted breathing and a surface water supply limited almost exclusively to the polar icecaps. Despite these drawbacks, Al Na‘ir was one of the Draconis Combine‘s more heavily industrialized border worlds in its heyday, home at one time to the Yori MechWorks, manufacturer of the galaxy-renowned Atlas, and Scarborough Manufacturers, makers of the Pegasus, Scimitar and other conventional combat vehicles.The Azami, a Muslim sect, initially settled Al Na‘ir as a base of operations for a mining industry, focused on the plentiful mineral-rich asteroids in the system. When the Combine took over, two of its largest military corporations—Luthien Armor Works and Alshain Weapons—exploited these valuable resources by subsidizing military industries on the planet. Yori MechWorks was established on Yori, the largest of the asteroids that orbit between Al Na‘ir and the fourth planet in the system, Al Abila. Scarborough Manufacturers was founded on the smaller southern continent of Scarborough, from which it took its name. Perhaps in part because of the initial Azami presence, coupled with the Combine‘s xenophobic attitude toward non-Japanese cultures, the Kuritan leadership eventually established the Combine‘s School for Cultural Investigation on Al Na‘ir‘s barren surface. Despite the extremely inhospitable locale, many Combine citizens flocked to Al Na‘ir to study the benefits and drawbacks of the non-Japanese cultures that thrived in realms beyond the reach of House Kurita. By the time of the Clan Invasion, Al Na‘ir had become an important part of the Combine‘s strategic infrastructure and economy, with a population nearing one billion, including those who lived in the mining and refining stations in the asteroid belt. The planet remained under heavy defensive guard by the Combine, though raids and assaults were infrequent, even by the Dragon‘s closest enemies. When the Blakist Jihad hit, however, Al Na‘ir‘s luck changed for the worse. Employing a battle fleet of fighter-carrying DropShips, backed up by mercenary ‘Mech forces, the Word of Blake systematically ravaged Yori MechWorks‘ asteroid mining and manufacturing centers, simultaneously striking the planet‘s surface defensive units. The assault crippled the central planetary industry, destroyed Yori‘s surface assembly plant, and left millions dead as domed cities were breached in the heavy fighting , including the former capital of Homai-Zaki. As of the 32nd century, only Scarborough Manufacturers—which now produces more heavy construction vehicles than fighting craft—and a handful of underground settlements linked to decimated mining operations remain. Devlin Stone‘s relocation plan and efforts to restore the less devastated settlements helped lure people back to Al Na‘ir, many of whom took up residence in the new prefecture capital city of Phoenix, located on the northern plains of Cedar Rock, Al Na‘ir‘s larger continent. The planetary capital of Homai-Zaki, repaired and repressurized after the Jihad, is on Cedar Rock as well.
